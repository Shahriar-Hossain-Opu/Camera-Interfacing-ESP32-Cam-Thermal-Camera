Working Procedure:
The ESP32 camera module enables us to capture images and video using the ESP32 microcontroller and the camera sensor. Here's a general overview of the working procedure to interface with and use the ESP32 camera module
Hardware Setup:
Connect the camera module to the ESP32 development board using appropriate wires. Make sure to connect the camera's data lines (D0-D9), power supply (VCC and GND), and control signals (RESET, PWDN, XCLK, HREF, PCLK, etc.) to the corresponding pins on the ESP32.
Library Installation:
To work with the camera module, we'll need to install the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) if we haven't already. The ESP-IDF provides a set of libraries and examples for camera interfacing. We can either download the ESP-IDF directly or use a development environment like PlatformIO.
Configuration:
Within our ESP-IDF project, we'll need to configure the camera settings. This includes setting up the pins for data and control signals, selecting the camera model (OV2640 or OV7670), setting image formats (JPEG, BMP, etc.), and adjusting resolution and frame rates.
Camera Initialization:
Initialize the camera module in our code using the camera library provided by ESP-IDF. This involves configuring the camera's registers, setting up the clock signals, and preparing the module for capturing images.
Capture Images:
Once the camera is initialized, we can start capturing images. Depending on our application, we can capture images on-demand, at regular intervals, or in response to specific events. Images are usually captured in the chosen format and stored in the ESP32's memory.
Display or Save Images:
After capturing an image, we can choose to display it on an attached display or save it to the ESP32's memory or an external storage device like an SD card. We'll need to use appropriate libraries to handle image storage and display.
Stream Video (Optional):
If we're interested in video streaming, we can capture a sequence of images in rapid succession and transmit them over Wi-Fi. This involves encoding the images into a video format and sending them to a client over a network connection.
Power Management:
Implement power management strategies to optimize energy consumption. This might involve putting the camera module or the entire ESP32 into low-power modes when the camera is not actively being used.
Advanced Features (Optional):
Depending on our project's requirements, we can explore advanced features like image processing, motion detection, object recognition, and integration with cloud services.
Testing and Optimization:
Test our application thoroughly to ensure proper functionality. Debug and optimize our code for performance, stability, and image quality. Consider factors like network latency and camera configuration to achieve the best results.
Documentation and Community Resources:
Throughout the process, refer to the ESP-IDF documentation, camera module datasheet, and community forums for guidance, examples, and solutions to common challenges.

AMG8833 Thermal Camera
The AMG8833 Grid-EYE is a low-cost infrared sensor array developed by Panasonic. For use with microcontrollers, it is integrated in a module with level shifters and voltage regulator allowing 3 - 5v power and data. 
The sensor has only 64 (8x8) pixels, which is not much but enough for experiments, simple to work with and it is cheap.
